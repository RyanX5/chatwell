# chatwell
A Gemini-based web app that gives personalized medical advice based on the user's profile.

#Inspiration
As the global population ages and chronic illnesses become more common, we realized that many patients struggle to understand complex medical instructions and maintain consistent health habits. We wanted to create a tool that empowers patients to take control of their health, understand their medical documents, and receive personalized, actionable recommendationsâ€”without being overwhelmed by jargon.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
